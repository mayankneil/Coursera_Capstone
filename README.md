Introduction:

The project intends to predict the accident severity for given road, weather, climate and other conditions among others. The dataset is taken from: 
US Accidents (3.5 million records), A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2020).
This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to June 2020, using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3.5 million accident records in this dataset
It is an effort to reduce car accidents or analyse data in such a way that we could help predict or at least warn the people driving to driver rather safe in a predicted accident prone area or spot. It is obviously considered an old topic but yet, with the progress of cars and the capabilities of the technology we need to have the right tools to be on the safer side or at least do our part for our safety.  

Data:

While searching for a meaningful dataset for my capstone project, I came across US Accidents (3.5 million records), A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset (2016 - 2020), which has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs. Currently, it contains accident data that are collected from February 2016 to June 2020 for the Contiguous United States

Dataset basically has these attributes to do the analysis on:

'ID', 'Source', 'TMC', 'Severity', 'Start Time', 'End Time',
       'Start Latitude', 'Start Latitude', 'End Latitude', 'End Latitude', ‘Distance (mi)',
       'Description', 'Number', 'Street', 'Side', 'City', 'County', 'State',
       'Zip code', 'Country', 'Time zone', 'Airport Code', 'Weather Timestamp',
       ‘Temperature (F)', 'Wind-chill(F)', 'Humidity(%)', 'Pressure(in)',
       ‘Visibility (mi)', 'Wind Direction', 'Wind Speed (mph)',
       ‘Precipitation (in)', 'Weather Condition', 'Amenity', 'Bump', 'Crossing',
       'Give Way', 'Junction', 'No Exit', 'Railway', 'Roundabout', 'Station',
       'Stop', 'Traffic Calming', 'Traffic Signal', 'Turning Loop',
       'Sunrise Sunset', 'Civil Twilight', 'Nautical Twilight',
       'Astronomical Twilight'


The dataset comes in a csv format with a pdf file containing a clear definition for each of the available features.
